Hello world!

I’m Clayton Davis—a seasoned AWS cloud consultant, technical leader and practice owner with over decade of hands-on experience helping organizations harness the power of the AWS cloud. Currently, I serve as Practice Leader for Software Engineering at [Caylent](https://caylent.com/), where I guide a talented team in delivering high-impact solutions across:

- **Application Modernization:** Re-architecting legacy systems for scale, resilience and reduced operational cost on AWS.  
- **Product Development:** Designing and building green-field SaaS applications, from MVP through production, using serverless, container and cloud-native patterns.  
- **GenAI Product Development:** Developing AI-driven features and services—chatbots, recommendation engines, code-generation tools—leveraging AWS Bedrock, OpenAI and other leading platforms.  
- **AI Accelerated Delivery:** Crafting frameworks and pipelines that compress release cycles—from months to weeks—while embedding security, compliance and quality gates.

Over the years, I’ve partnered with more than 500 clients—from nimble startups to Fortune-scale enterprises—tackling everything from deep infrastructure challenges (think cross-account IAM, complex VPC architectures, large-scale data migrations) to application development at scale (microservices design, cloud-native CI/CD) and “layer-8” problems like organizational alignment and delivery process re-engineering.  

### Why I Write 

In both boardroom strategy sessions and war-room troubleshooting calls, I form strong opinions about how AI, DevOps and cloud best practices intersect—and evolve—at lightning speed. This blog is my living notebook: a place to share real-world lessons, challenge conventional wisdom and document my thinking on emerging cloud and AI trends.

### A Bit of Backstory  

- **Network Foundations:** My career started in network engineering—designing and troubleshooting enterprise LAN/WAN environments.  
- **DevOps & Microservices:** I pivoted into DevOps, building and shipping microservice-driven applications on AWS.  
- **Leadership Development:** A leadership-focused management program sharpened my people-skills and strategic thinking.  
- **Consulting Journey:** Since 2015, I’ve navigated through engineering, architecture, delivery management and now practice leadership—each role adding new layers of insight.

### On Imperfection & Progress  
I live by one guiding principle: “Perfection is the enemy of progress.” That keeps me shipping, iterating and learning—and it’s exactly what this blog will do. I aim to publish thoughtful pieces at least once a month, though you might see bonus posts when a hot topic or opinionated client conversation ignites something fresh.
