Hello World!

My name is Clayton. I have spent the last 6 years of my life doing AWS cloud consulting for a few companies. I am currently with [Caylent](https://caylent.com/) as a Delivery Manager. I started off in engineering, worked my way through architecture, and have most recently found myself in this delivery manager role where I focus more on people development and client management. At this point, I have worked on well over 50 different client environments solving a vast array of problems. Sometimes I solve very challenging technical issues, other times I solve very challenging layer 8 problems. 

Recently, I have found myself involved in a lot of high-level conversations with clients about their direction in the cloud and have realized that consulting has made me extremely opinionated about many topics. <em>Enter blog</em>. My goal is to use this blog to share my opinions about things as they happen, also as a way to document my thoughts on a particular topic at a particular time because the cloud continues to evolve and the tools you use and the methodologies you use to manage it do as well.

Prior to my days in consulting I went to school to be a network engineer, spent some time in a management focused leadership program, and played buzzword bingo in a developer/devops role focused on building microservices. My background is a bit all over the place, but so is the cloud, so it aligns nicely.

Please feel free to reach out if there is anything I can do for you. blog@claytondavis.dev
