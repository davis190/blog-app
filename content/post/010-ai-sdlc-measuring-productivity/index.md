*Third instalment in the “AI-Powered Engineering” series*

You can see part 1 [here](/post/008-ai-sdlc-hybrid-approach/index.html) and part 2 [here](/post/009-ai-sdlc-quality/index.html)

**TL;DR**

1. Traditional agile metrics are fallible under AI acceleration and need to be reworked.  
2. Swap opinion-based inputs (story points) for *data you can’t game*: flow, quality, complexity, and experience.  
3. Instrument **before** your first AI pilot or you’ll be chasing a moving baseline forever.

### **Why “Show Me the Numbers” Suddenly Matters**

Gen AI promises 2-10x output per engineer, but finance, security, and HR still ask the same question: *“How do we know?”* Slide-deck anecdotes won’t cut it—especially when a Board is approving seven-figure Gen AI budgets.

### **2 Legacy Metrics—and Why They Break**

| Legacy Metric | Why It Breaks in an AI World |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Story-point velocity** | Humans re-calibrate estimates once AI tooling feels “normal,” creating a *false regression* even if output rises. |
| **Bug density (bugs ÷ points or LOC)** | Story-point denominator shrinks; LOC explodes or shrinks depending on LLM style—ratio becomes noise. |
| **Manual cycle-time sampling** | Once commits land every hour, clipboard analytics can’t keep up. |

### **3 Principles for Next-Gen Measurement**

1. **Automated:** Numbers flow straight from your toolchain, not human opinion.  
2. **Outcome-based:** Focus on *value delivered*, not effort spent.  
3. **Real-time & historical:** Dashboards should refresh daily *and* let you compare to last quarter.  
4. **Harder-to-game:** Prefer metrics derived from immutable events (merge, deploy, restore) and unbiased.

### **4 Metric Stack for the AI Era**

| Layer | What to Track | Why It Works |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Flow** | **DORA 4** – Lead-time for changes, deployment frequency, change-failure rate, MTTR | Captures *speed* & *stability* in one bundle ﻿ |
| **Quality** | Defect rate, flaky-test trend, pass-rate of **AI-generated tests** | Objective pass/fail; surfaces hidden regression debt |
| **Complexity** | Cyclomatic & cognitive complexity per KLOC; cost-to-produce via *scc* | LOC alone is noisy; complexity can normalize LLM verbosity ﻿ |
| **Experience** | Dev-survey pulse (flow state, tool friction), Copilot adoption telemetry | Productivity ≠ happiness, but correlated ﻿ |
| **Outcome** | Features/week, revenue per deploy, customer-satisfaction delta | Ties engineering to business value |

### **5 Practical Baseline Playbook**

1. **Freeze a quarter of pre-AI data**—extract DORA, defect counts, complexity, NPS-style DevEx scores.  
2. **Pilot with an A/B model:**  
   * *Control team* ships as usual.  
   * *Pilot team* adopts AI-powered patterns, gen-AI tests, and auto-sizing using prescriptive guidance  
   * Measure all the things and compare  
3. **Instrument everything:**  
   * Git hooks publish commit metadata.  
   * MCP for tool connectivity driving more efficiency  
   * CI posts DORA \+ complexity stats to a warehouse.  
   * Weekly Slack bot triggers a one-minute DevEx survey.  
4. **Run for 6–8 weeks.**  
5. **Compare deltas** (and normalise for scope creep). [Google’s 2025 DORA-AI study](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/sharing-new-dora-research-for-gen-ai-in-software-development) found even a **2 % lift in individual productivity** with just a 25% bump in AI usage ﻿ —small, yes, but compounding over quarters.

### **6 Modern Alternatives to Story-Point Sizing**

| Method | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **LLM-based sizing agent** | Prompt an LLM with codebase context \+ story text; returns a complexity bucket (XS–XL) | Consistent, instant, bias-free | Needs prompt tuning; difficult to plan sprint capacity |
| **Automated scope-diff** | Measure delta in file-touches & complexity *after* merge; back-fill effort score | Zero manual input | Post-factum only; can’t forecast work |
| **Third-party “effort” heuristics** | Tools like scc run COCOMO-style cost estimates on PR diff | Works per-commit; language-agnostic | Estimates, not actual hours |

**Pro tip:** If you *must* keep sprints, map your new complexity buckets to Fibonacci points—but lock the mapping in a config file so it can’t drift.

### **7 Key Takeaways**

* **Stop treating story points as gospel.** They were a workaround for data you can now collect automatically.  
  **Baseline early, iterate often.** Measuring *after* you scale AI is like weighing luggage *after* the flight.  
* **Use a portfolio of metrics.** Flow \+ Quality \+ Complexity \+ Experience paints the full picture and resists gaming.
