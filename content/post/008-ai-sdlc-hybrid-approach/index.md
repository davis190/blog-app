### **Introduction: Planning vs. Building, Redux**

For the past few decades, enterprise software teams followed a familiar rhythm:

1. **Product strategy first.** Nail the market, persona, features, roadmap. Ensure the thing you are building has a place.  
2. **Design strategy next.** Map user journeys, retention loops, and KPIs. Building out screens as a first pass to solicit feedback as a way to “dip your toe in”  
3. **Engineering last.** Kick-off happens months—sometimes a full year—after the first discovery workshop. But at least engineering has a clear path forward… until scope creep

That waterfall of wisdom made sense when a single code iteration carried a **five-figure price tag** and shipping features was hard and time consuming.

In the rest of this blog I want to look at how Gen AI can flip this model on its head, deliver faster outcomes, for a fraction of the price

### **Why AI Pushed Us Past “Strategy-Led”**

Early adopters sprinted to prove AI could tackle thorny problems—think one-week proof-of-concepts built in Cursor, shipped to AWS, demo-ready overnight. The mindset flipped:

* **Engineering-first POCs** became the entry ticket. Can AI solve the problem that I’m having  
* Strategy arrived *after* a working demo to see how it could fit into the company / product.  
* However, technical teams often found themselves with a shiny hammer (POC), still searching for nails (market fit).

The result? Misaligned products, technical dead-ends, and the dreaded “AI prototype graveyard.”

### **Enter the Hybrid Model**

AI doesn’t kill strategy; it collapses the distance between strategy and execution.

| Old World | New Hybrid World |
| ----- | ----- |
| Months of discovery → spec freeze → dev start | Continuous strategy \+ rapid engineering effort \= daily shipping |
| Feedback every release cycle | Rapid feature iterations with constant feedback fueling strategy and engineering iterations |
| Costly pivots | Cheap, compounding micro-pivots delivering quick iterations to users |

**Key insight:** *When iteration is cheap, over-planning is expensive.* The virtuous loop is:

1. **Directional strategy** embedded in the team  
2. **Rapid AI-assisted engineer** → working prototype in hours to days (as opposed to weeks or months).  
3. **User or product owner clicks through** → concrete just-in-time feedback.  
4. **Loop back** with refined strategy, requirements, and planning for the next iteration.

The tighter that loop, the faster you converge on product-market fit.

### **Real-World Walkthrough**

Imagine a product manager running user interviews Monday–Wednesday.

* Every evening, Zoom recordings feed an agent that extracts requirements and loads them into Jira.  
* Another agent finds ambiguous areas and preps the product manager follow up questions for the next day's meeting  
* Engineers are feeding requirements into an AI-assisted tool to write code and deploy it to AWS  
* Thursday morning the product manager demos a live, clickable prototype—no mock-ups, the real thing.  
* Customer reactions feed directly into the next nightly build.

**Outcome:** What used to be a quarterly “discovery \+ design sprint” now can happen three times in a single week.

### **Why “Cheap Iterations” Matter**

When changing direction and iterating is fast and costs pennies, the penalty for being *slightly* wrong shrinks. You no longer have to wait for the “perfect requirement" to move forward. But if you skip strategy entirely, the speed of your AI-powered development engine will happily speed you off a cliff in the wrong direction before you know what happened. The hybrid model protects against that risk:

* **Guardrails** \= a lightweight but explicit strategy checkpoint every cycle.  
* **Throttle** \= automated tests and quality gates (we’ll dive deep in Part 2).  
* **Flywheel** \= each build generates more context—code, tests, analytics—that makes the next AI suggestion even better.

### **Closing & Teaser**

In short, AI hasn’t replaced strategy; it’s **re-sequenced** it.
