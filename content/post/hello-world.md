Hello World!

I guess as a test blog I can introduce myself. My name is Clayton. I have spent the last 6 years of my life doing AWS cloud consulting for a few companies. I started off in engineering, worked my way through architecture, and have most recently found myself more on the people and client management side of things. At this point, I have worked on well over 50 different client environments solving a vast array of problems. Sometimes I solve very challenging technical issues, other times I solve very challenging layer 8 problems. 

Recently, I have found myself involved in a lot of high-level conversations with clients and have realized that consulting has made me extremely opinionated about some topics. My goal is to use this blog to share my opinions about things as they happen, also as a way to document my thoughts on a particular topic at a particular time.

My tech stack, being the cloud, is a bit all over the place. You can expect content and opinions ranging from network design, application migrations, application modernization, automation, tooling, and whatever else gets me all riled up.

Signing off for now so I can see if I can deploy this blog.
